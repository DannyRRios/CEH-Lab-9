This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab it was pretty simple. It was mostly just finding infromation that could be used in a phishing scam or how to perform one. The first thing we did was sniff credentials using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET). We then practiced how to detect phishing through Netcraft and Phishtank. Lastly we had to audit organization's security for phishing attacks using OhPhish. The only  thing was that it requires you to email ECcouncil about a account so as instructed from class I just reviewed what they were doing and took a screenshot of the step beforethat.
